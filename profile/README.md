# Lethal Company Community resources

This unofficial organisation was created in order to make various resources available to the community in an open-source, collaborative format.

It is primarily made for the modding community, though guides and tools aimed at other parts of the community are absolutely welcome.

## Important links
- The modding [wiki](https://github.com/LethalCompany/LethalCompanyModdingWiki) will help you get started in modding the game.
- A [template repository](https://github.com/LethalCompany/LethalCompanyTemplate) exists, allowing for a quick start into modding. Note that you'll still need to do some [initial setup](https://github.com/LethalCompany/LethalCompanyModdingWiki/wiki/Initial-setup)!
- The [Unofficial Lethal Company Community](https://discord.gg/nYcQFEpXfU) is this organisation's official discord server. It hosts both general community channels, as well as a modding category.
